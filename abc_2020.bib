  abstract = {The progression of pest eradication to inhabited islands is now possible due to the knowledge gained from successful eradications on uninhabited islands. However, the success of this is likely to be influenced by the attitudes of landowners. The consistency of island inhabitants' attitudes towards pest management, both within and among islands, is currently unknown. Therefore, we assessed the environmental and pest management attitudes of the communities of four inhabited islands in the Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand (Rakino Island, Kawau Island, Great Barrier Island (Aotea Island) and Waiheke Island) and compared the results with an adjacent mainland community to better understand this social influence. The results suggested that respondents from all four island communities had more overarching support for pest management and conservation in general than those from the mainland, reflecting greater levels of environmental concern. While it might be expected that strong positive environmental attitudes would translate into strong positive pest management attitudes, this was not always the case, with greater levels of uncertainty being associated with attitudes towards pest management. In particular, values associated with the environment and place attachment were related to environmental attitudes but were unrelated to pest management attitudes. The results do suggest, however, that pest eradication may have had long-term positive effects on the attitudes of inhabited island communities, with the residents of the only island from which rats have been eradicated (Rakino) having consistently more positive attitudes towards pest control. The findings of this study will help identify areas for future engagement and ways in which barriers to achieving pest eradication can be overcome.},

The new study identifies several previously unreported species for Harataonga, and the first record of prehistoric Maori use of Black Petrel or Taiko (Procellaria parkinsoni), and possibly Pycroft's Petrel (Pterodroma pycrofti). The assemblages are dominated by seabirds, a common pattern for the South Island but unusual for more northern areas, where forest birds are typically better represented. The limited forest birds are concentrated in the early occupation. Combining the two studies broadens our understanding of past species distributions on Great Barrier Island, and Maori use of these resources over time. Analytically, comparison of the two studies, one conducted some time ago, demonstrates the impact of fine-mesh sieves and in-lab processing on the observed assemblage size, composition, and diversity.},

  abstract = {New Zealand's forest plants evolved in the absence of mammalian herbivores, but subject to the attentions of a variety of other animals. Insects are and probably were, the primary folivores, but birds may also have been important. Several extinct birds, notably moas (Dinornithidae), were herbivores, and speculation continues about their impact on the vegetation. Among existing forest birds, both kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) and kokako (Callaeas cinerea) can significantly defoliate plants and may have had a greater impact in the past. Beneficial interactions of birds with forest plants include pollination and seed dispersal. Flower visitation by birds has already been reviewed, but the importance of frugivory and seed dispersal by birds has hitherto been given scant regard in New Zealand. About 70\% of the woody plants in New Zealand forests have fruits suited for vertebrate dispersal and, of these, most are probably dispersed by birds. The recent extinction of several frugivorous forest birds (e.g., moas, piopio Turnagra capensis, huia Heterolocha acutirostris) and the decline of others (e.g., kokako) has reduced the number of potential seed dispersers, especially for large-fruited species, some of which now depend almost entirely on kereru for seed dispersal. A similar recent loss of potential seed dispersers has occurred throughout Polynesia, but consequent effects on patterns of forest regeneration are unknown.},

The total population was estimated at {$\approx$}260 adults. Most birds were resident on Rangatira Island in spring, summer and autumn but moved to Pitt Island during the winter. In spring birds commuted between the two islands but became resident on Rangatira when breeding commenced. Radio transmitters were attached to adult tui to monitor breeding. No radio-tagged female bred (n = 13) but at least two of three radio-tagged males raised young. Adult tui were intolerant of disturbance during nesting so estimation of productivity was made by mapping the number of fledgling groups. Flax (Phormium tenax) nectar appeared to be the most important food for breeding tui and birds travelled long distances to visit flowering plants. Fruits of ngaio (Myoporum laetum), matipo (Myrsine chathamica), karamu (Coprosma chathamica), mahoe (Melicytus chathamicus) and muehlenbeckia (Muehlenbeckia australis) were also important foods. Invertebrates were most important when females were feeding their young. The amount of breeding that occurred each season was directly related to the abundance of flax flowers in spring, and in good flax flowering years tui were able to rear two broods. In poor flax flowering years many birds did not breed. Control of feral cats on Pitt Island would most likely result in a significant increase in this breeding population; however planting of flax adjacent to the forest areas on Chatham Island along with predator control may be necessary before tui can re-establish there.},

The method has been undertaken consistently for nearly 40 years leading to a large resource of counts (over 200 000). These counts are valuable as they often provide our only historical baseline measure of multi-species bird populations in New Zealand forests. Over 120 000 counts are held in the 5MBC database. The method was used between 1973 and 1992 by the DSIR, NZ Wildlife Service and NZ Forest Service to investigate important ecological questions such as which forests are important for which bird species, and whether pest control operations affect bird populations. The method played a role in persuading the government to cease all logging of native forests on public land in New Zealand in 2002. Reviewing 5MBC studies suggests a number of features of the method that should be considered when designing a study including that (1) it is an index not a census method, (2) observer, species behaviour, weather and season can all affect the number of birds detected, (3) counts are habitat- species- and probably year- specific preventing inter-species comparisons, and comparisons of species numbers at different sites if the counts were undertaken in different years. The method is suitable for investigating long term trends but there is likely to be considerable annual variability and a pilot study should be undertaken to investigate the number of counts needed to detect the difference of interest (i.e. power). The Department of Conservation website includes pages that provide resources for counters including standard data recording sheets. At present counters cannot enter their data into the 5MBC database and there is a risk that data from counts will continue to be lost.},

Comparative studies on the songs of birds between islands and mainland populations provide insight into the evolution of vocal communication in terms of both ecological and social factors. We compared the vocalisations of tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae novaeseelandiae), an endemic honeyeater from New Zealand's mainland, with those of a subspecies from the remote Chatham Islands (P. n. chathamensis). Song spectral variables of male long-range `broadcasting' songs differed between mainland and Chatham Island tui populations. Songs recorded from five mainland populations had significantly greater syllable diversity and produced a higher percentage of trills than those from the Chatham Islands. These characteristics have been revealed in past studies as being sexually selected traits positively correlated with male genetic diversity. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis could also help to elucidate the presence of a significantly higher percentage of trill components in the songs of the mainland population, as the mainland study sites in general contained more areas of open vegetation, where trills transmit more effectively than in dense forest, which dominated the sampling sites on the Chatham Islands. Future research into the variation of tui song complexity in relation to population size, geographic isolation, and habitat structure between different mainland sites would provide further insight into links between selective pressures and vocal complexity.},

  abstract = {Holdaway (1989) described three phases of historical extinctions and declines in New Zealand avifauna, the last of which (Group III, declining 1780\textendash 1986) was associated with European hunting, habitat clearance, and predation and competition from introduced European mammals. Some forest bird species have continued to decline since 1986, while others have increased, usually after intensive species-specific research and management programmes. In this paper, we review what is known about major causes of current declines or population limitation, including predation, competition for food or another resource, disease, forest loss, and genetic problems such as inbreeding depression and reduced genetic variation. Much experimental and circumstantial evidence suggests or demonstrates that predation by introduced mammals remains the primary cause of declines and limitation in remaining large native forest tracts. Predation alone is generally sufficient to explain the observed declines, but complex interactions between factors that vary between species and sites are likely to be the norm and are difficult to study. Currently, the rather limited evidence for food shortage is mostly circumstantial and may be obscured by interactions with predation. Climate and food supply determine the number of breeding attempts made by herbivorous species, but predation by introduced mammals ultimately determines the outcome of those attempts. After removal of pest mammals, populations are apparently limited by other factors, including habitat area, food supply, disease or avian predators. Management of these, and of inbreeding depression in bottlenecked populations, is likely to assist the effectiveness and resilience of management programmes. At the local or regional scale, however, forest area itself may be limiting in deforested parts of New Zealand. Without predator management, the number of native forest birds on the New Zealand mainland is predicted to continue to decline.},

  abstract = {Worldwide declines in bird numbers have recently renewed interest in how well bird\textendash plant mutualisms are functioning. In New Zealand, it has been argued that bird pollination was relatively unimportant and birdpollination failure was unlikely to threaten any New Zealand plants, whereas dispersal mutualisms were widespread and in some cases potentially at risk because of reliance on a single large frugivore, the kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae). Work since 1989, however, has changed that assessment. Smaller individual fruits of most plant species can be dispersed by mid-sized birds such as tui (Prosthemadera novaezelandiae) because both fruits and birds vary in size within a species. Only one species (Beilschmiedia tarairi) has no individual fruits small enough for this to occur. Germination of 19 fleshy-fruited species, including most species with fruits {$>$}8 mm diameter, does not depend on birds removing the fruit pulp. The few studies of fruit removal rates mostly (7 out of 10) show good dispersal quantity. So dispersal is less at risk than once thought. In contrast, there is now evidence for widespread pollen limitation in species with ornithophilous flowers. Tests on 10 of the 29 known native ornithophilous-flowered species found that in 8 cases seed production was reduced by at least one-third, and the pollen limitation indices overall were significantly higher than the global average. Birds also frequently visit flowers of many other smaller-flowered native species, and excluding birds significantly reduced seed set in the three species tested. So pollination is more at risk than once thought. Finally, analyses of both species numbers and total woody basal area show that dependence on bird pollination is unexpectedly high. Birds have been recorded visiting the flowers of 85 native species, representing 5\% of the total seed-plant flora (compared with 12\% of those with fleshy fruit) and 30\% of the tree flora (compared with 59\% with fleshy fruit). A higher percentage of New Zealand forest basal area has bird-visited flowers (37\% of basal area nationally) than fleshy fruit (31\%). Thus, bird pollination is more important in New Zealand than was realised, partly because birds visit many flowers that do not have classic ``ornithophilous'' flower morphology.},

The full sampling protocol (five count stations surveyed on each of two consecutive days) was implemented at 80\% of sampling locations.

Most observations were based on aural cues (particularly in forest and shrubland). On average, one additional species was recorded per sampling location in ten- versus five-minute counts. Analyses highlighted spatial heterogeneity as a major factor influencing detection probabilities both for species present and for individuals of those species at sampling locations. This issue is often overlooked when estimating bird population trends through time. Most endemic species were detected in forest, while native and introduced species were most frequently detected in shrub.

  abstract = {The kaka (Nestor meridionalis) is a threatened, endemic New Zealand parrot that is declining primarily because of predation by introduced mammals. Numbers of female kaka surviving to sexual maturity more than compensated for adult female mortality at three sites with predator control but not at three unmanaged sites. Nesting success at the sites with predator control was significantly greater ({$\geqslant$}80\%) than at unmanaged sites ({$\leqslant$}38\%) while predation on adult females was significantly less (5\% c.f. 65\%). Predation was the most common cause of nesting failure at all sites. Stoats (Mustela erminea) appeared to be the main predator, although evidence of possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) predation on eggs, nestlings and nesting females was also found. These results suggest that control of stoats and possums can potentially reverse the decline of the kaka on the main islands of New Zealand.},

This paper describes the sequential impacts of Maori and European people on the process of estuarine vegetation succession in time and space, and the rate of estuarine sedimentation. Multiple cores from one estuary gave confidence in assessing the temporal sequence of vegetation change, but bioturbation and other disturbance factors made it difficult to interpret 14C dates from the estuarine environment. The modern vegetation zonation pattern on the estuary is an active succession, which has been generated by rapid estuary in-filling, probably initiated as a consequence of erosion following Maori burning of the adjacent forest. European forest clearance for agriculture resulted in a further increase in estuarine sedimentation, and may have re-activated earlier sediments trapped in adjacent swamps. The combined effects of two phases of human exploitation have resulted in large-scale loss of nutrients and top-soil from catchments throughout Great Barrier Island. Conservation management of the estuary should take account of the anthropogenic impacts that have driven the plant succession and created the current vegetation zonation pattern. This pattern is neither static nor `natural', but rather an on-going response to the changing human activities in the surrounding catchment.},

Community based trusts are spear-heading ecological studies to support conservation and a pest eradication programme. Rodent numbers are greatest in late summer/autumn and lowest in winter/early spring. Maximum abundances were recorded in riparian and coastal vegetation, and in mature forest. Monitoring shows that trapping alone is not able to reduce rat numbers sufficiently for safety in avian re-introductions. A combination of trapping and strategically pulsed toxin baits, however, achieved low levels of rats. Ecosystem recovery is demonstrated by increases in key tree seedlings, large invertebrates and lizards in managed compared to unmanaged areas, and by the survivorship of translocated robins (Petroica longipes). The Great Barrier Island Charitable Trust is communicating these benefits, and associated risks, to the Island community, with a view to promoting pest eradication as a key component in an ecology-based economy, centred on eco-tourism.},

We found 48 nests both in natural nesting sites and in nest boxes, in all three major habitat types on the island. Clutch size declined as the breeding season progressed, but laying date did not affect nesting success. This means that a breeding pair could fledge at least one young even from a small clutch laid late in the breeding season. Overall nesting success was 60\%. Nesting success varied between breeding-seasons. Most of the 17 nesting attempts that failed did so during incubation. Red-crowned parakeets made use of a wide diversity of nesting sites and few sites were re-used, which suggests that suitable nest sites were not limiting. Overall, our results indicate that red-crowned parakeets are good candidates for reintroductions to areas lacking introduced predators, even during the early stages of revegetation.},

In contrast, little is known about the intrinsic intra-brood dynamics responsible for modulating fledging success in parrots breeding at sites free of introduced nest predators. We studied red-crowned parakeets over two breeding seasons on Tiritiri Matangi, an offshore island free of introduced mammalian predators. We analysed the patterns of hatching and survival, and sex-specific growth of nestlings in relation to clutch initiation date and natural levels of hatching asynchrony. We also explored the relationships of nestling sex and hatching rank on survival. Earlier laid clutches resulted in larger broods which in turn produced more nestlings in better body condition, independent of the sex of the nestlings. Similar to many other bird species with extensive hatching asynchrony, last hatched red-crowned parakeets suffered higher mortality than other hatch ranks. Primary sex ratios and sex ratios at hatching and fledging did not deviate significantly from parity. Our results indicate that in the absence of nest predation by exotic predators, the timing of clutch initiation and brood reduction due to starvation of last hatched nestlings are the most important determinants of nestling survival and growth in red-crowned parakeets. Consequently, from a conservation management perspective, close monitoring of target populations during the breeding season is recommended to estimate nestling survival and nest productivity when planning the timing of capture of wild birds for translocations or harvesting potential breeding stock for captive breeding programmes.}

  abstract = {Fire has been a major driver of forest loss in New Zealand. A conceptual model has been proposed in which positive feedbacks between vegetation, fire and soils can arrest regeneration of recurrently burned wet forest landscapes. We used vegetation data collected across three topographically similar landscapes \textendash{} Awana, Glenfern and Windy Hill \textendash{} on Great Barrier Island to (1) describe current vegetation composition and structure and predict future change in composition and (2) assess evidence for interactions between fire and soils slowing regeneration in these landscapes. Compositional data were analysed via classification and ordination, and we used transition matrix models to explore how vegetation composition may change in the future. The vegetation in the three landscapes spans repeatedly burned scrubland dominated by m\=anuka (Leptospermum scoparium) and exotic fire-dependent woody species such as Hakea sericea, to intact mature forest. Scrubland vegetation tends to be found on north-facing upper slopes and ridges \textendash{} drier sites where fire has been more frequent and rendered soil conditions (e.g. organic matter and moisture) poor for plant growth. There is a slow reinvasion of forest species into the Leptospermum and Kunzea scrubland from gullies and other remnant patches, with wind-dispersed species preceding fleshy-fruited bird-dispersed ones. In the absence of fire in the next few decades the landscapes will continue to move back towards forest. More fires, however, will further degrade these landscapes by removing remaining fertile topsoils from ridges and slopes and by favouring exotic species adapted to recruit from seed and/or resprout vegetatively after fire.},

Step-change is required to unleash the conservation and restoration potential of biodiversity on inhabited islands around the globe, and avoid the pitfalls previous attempts to eradicate invasive species on inhabited islands have fallen into. Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is a systematic decision support process, aiming to ensure that environmental and other sustainability aspects are considered effectively throughout policy, plan and programme making. Within the framework of SEAs, on target islands eradication planners could implement a number of tools including stakeholder engagement, social impact assessment and economic cost-benefit analysis alongside existing environmental impact assessment. Such a suite of assessments capture the immediate impacts of an eradication operation on a range of values, alongside predicted long-term changes in these tightly coupled socio-ecological systems. In this paper we outline what SEA is, and then contrast invasive species management attempts occurring outside an SEA framework on two similar but also contrasting UNESCO World Heritage islands; Lord Howe Island, Australia and Fernando de Noronha, Brazil. We then demonstrate how an SEA approach to invasive species management would assist planning in New Zealand to eradicate introduced mammalian predators from two large offshore islands in New Zealand; Aotea (Great Barrier Island) and Rakiura (Stewart Island). We conclude with future prospects for applying SEA to invasive species management on inhabited islands.},

Tui return for breeding but again the timing of the return varies for individuals. Nectar sources were typically concentrated in both time and space, and access was related to individual asymmetries such as sex, residential status and age. These same asymmetries also relate to the timing of individuals movements, and where individuals nest relative to nectar sources. At concentrated food sources, access was determined by an absolute social hierarchy. Although tui defend exclusive feeding territories, breeding territories are not exclusive and access to nectar is determined by distance to nest site. Such variability in spatial organisation is related to a continuum concept of social organisation.},

We analysed three decades of summer p\=ateke flock count data collected at `trapped' and `untrapped' locations to assess numerical p\=ateke response to predator control. Using piecewise regression, we found that Northland p\=ateke at trapped sites increased from 130 individuals before predator control, to 341 by 2015. Conversely, p\=ateke in untrapped areas in Northland remain low. Compared with the Northland trapped site, there was a slower rate of population increase in the predator treated site at Okiwi on Great Barrier Island; 286 individuals at trapped sites before predator control and 390 individuals in 2015. P\=ateke numbers at untrapped sites on Great Barrier Island also increased, from 214 to 316 individuals. Cause of death analyses confirm that predation is a significant factor at trapped sites in Northland (87\% of p\=ateke deaths) and Okiwi (56\% of deaths), with starvation accounting for an additional 16\% of identified causes of death at Okiwi. Access to sufficient food sources may be limiting at Okiwi, but overall the provision of predator control has benefitted p\=ateke populations.},

  abstract = {Aim World-wide declines in large-bodied frugivores may change seed deposition patterns dramatically if body mass influences seed dispersal-related traits, such as dispersal distance. We quantified movement patterns and seed dispersal distances by Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae (kereru), the fifth-largest surviving pigeon world-wide. We then reviewed how body mass affects seed dispersal distance among fruit-eating birds globally. Location Taranaki and Canterbury, New Zealand. Methods We radio-tracked 24 kereru, following each bird continuously for up to 8.5 h, for a total of 43 tracking-days during the peak fruiting season (February\textendash April). We estimated seed dispersal distances for three fleshy-fruited species using a mechanistic model based on kereru movements and seed retention times. We analysed global data for volant avian frugivores to determine the effect of body mass on time spent in fruiting trees, seed retention time, and dispersal distance. Results Kereru were highly sedentary, with an average of 32 {$\pm$} 39 (mean {$\pm$} SD) minutes and maximum of 315 minutes between flights. Kereru flew a mean of 77 {$\pm$} 159 m and maximum of 1457 m in a single flight. They dispersed 66\textendash 87\% of ingested seeds away from the parent plant. Mean seed dispersal distances for Beilschmiedia tawa, Vitex lucens and Pseudopanax arboreus were 95, 98 and 61 m, respectively, with all species dispersed up to 1469 m. For all three species, 79\textendash 88\% of seeds were dispersed {$<$} 100 m and {$<$} 1\% were dispersed {$>$} 1 km from the parent plant. Globally, both the mean time spent in fruiting trees and seed retention time increased with increasing frugivore body mass. However, retention time increased faster, and therefore the dispersal distance and percentage of seeds moved away from the parent increased with body mass. Main conclusions Despite sedentary behaviour, kereru disperse many seeds away from the parent plant due to their even longer gut passage time, a function of their large size. Large-bodied frugivores are disproportionately important as dispersers not only because they can swallow larger fruits, but also because they are more likely to deposit seeds away from the parent plant and at greater distances.},
