# ABC data 2020

Attempted to follow the format of the 2019 datasheet. 
For programming purposes: 'Y' and 'N' are replaced with '1' and '0'. '-' replaced with 'NA'

Transet name is the initial of each location A = awana, CC = Cooper's Castle following the alphabetical order of directries

Lots of data are inconsistently recorded among groups. Input as best as possible.
